For centuries, the Queen was one of the weakest pieces, moving only one square diagonally. Her transformation into the most powerful piece on the board happened in Europe around the 15th century, and this new, faster version of the game was sometimes called "Mad Queen's Chess" (*scacchi alla rabiosa*).

The first foldable chessboard was invented in 1125 by a priest. Since the Church forbade priests from playing games, he designed the board to fold in half and look like two books lying together on a shelf.

The modern, powerful Queen was only introduced around the 15th century. Before that, her predecessor piece could only move one square diagonally. This change was so dramatic and accelerated the game so much that early modern chess was often called "*scacchi alla rabiosa*"—Italian for "Madwoman's Chess."

Before the 15th century, the Queen was one of the weakest pieces in chess, moving only one square diagonally. When her move was changed to the powerful version we know today, the new rule was so dramatic that the game was sometimes called "scacchi alla rabiosa" — or "Madwoman's Chess."

A beautifully cruel concept in chess is the German term *Zugzwang*, which translates to "compulsion to move." This is a situation where a player is put at a disadvantage specifically because they *must* make a move. While having the turn to move is normally a right, in a state of Zugzwang, any legal move a player can make will fatally weaken their position, often leading directly to a loss. It is a key weapon, especially in endgames, where the obligation to move becomes a decisive trap.

A fascinating and pivotal moment in chess history is the "Interregnum" of 1946–1948. For two years, the world had no reigning Chess Champion.

This occurred because the fourth World Champion, Alexander Alekhine, died in 1946 while still holding the title—the only champion in history to do so. With no established challenger or protocol, the chess world was left in an unprecedented situation. FIDE (the World Chess Federation) stepped in and organized a landmark tournament in 1948, inviting the five strongest players of the era. Mikhail Botvinnik won decisively, ushering in the modern system of FIDE-controlled championship cycles.

For centuries, a pawn could only be promoted to a piece that had already been captured. This meant a player could never possess two Queens, for example. If no pieces were available for promotion, the pawn would have to remain a pawn on the final rank until a piece was captured. The modern rule allowing promotion to any desired piece was not standardized until the 19th century.
